This is my implementation of the random quote generator challenge on FreeCodeCamp.org: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

FEATURES
This app produces a random quote every time the "New Quote" button is pressed.

The color scheme of the page should also change with every click of the "New Quote" button.

The user can tweet the quote by simply pressing the button with the twitter logo on it.

TECHNOLOGIES
HTML, CSS (SASS), Javascript
